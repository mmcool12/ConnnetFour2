Hello welcome to our c4 game, our game can be played with four simple steps:
    1. First run final.py
    2. Second create a board
        - Any size works however the graphics window does not scale therefore
        we recommend either (7,7) or (7,6)
    3. run Board.final() and on-screen prompts will guide you from therefore
    4. Have Fun!!!
